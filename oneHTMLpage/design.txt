slime - sometimes splits, random movement

ghost - moves directly towards player ignoring walls (will need to include tile saving to prevent incorrect char replacement)

beheaded - moves blindly changing direction upon hitting walls, moves in last direction of player when encountered at melee range

gorgon - moves 2 at a time but only moves every 2 turns, it's attack makes you skip a turn (turned to stone)

snake - doesn't move normally. moves away after attacking you eating enemy in it's way, killing fed snake gives unique enemy loot s -> S

armor - 

skull - teleports to and away from the player attacks twice be turn

bug - moves in random increments and at different ranges

scarecrow - 

if any find themselves next to a player they will attack instead of moving
